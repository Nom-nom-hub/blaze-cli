# Blaze-install Roadmap (2025â€“2027)

## Completed Milestones

- [x] Fast, parallelized installs with global cache
- [x] Content-addressable storage (CAS) for tarballs
- [x] Robust lockfile and dependency management
- [x] Workspace/monorepo support (workspaces field, multi-package installs)
- [x] Plugin system with before/after hooks for all major commands
- [x] Peer and optional dependency support with clear warnings
- [x] Self-healing and diagnostics (`blaze doctor`, `--fix`)
- [x] Offline mode (`--offline`) for cache-only installs
- [x] Prefetch/cache warming (`blaze prefetch`)
- [x] Interactive upgrades (`blaze upgrade`)
- [x] Dependency graph output (Mermaid.js)
- [x] Modern, beautiful CLI with progress bars and colored output
- [x] Automatic lockfile pruning after uninstall/update
- [x] Audit/security checks using npm audit API
- [x] Lifecycle script support (preinstall, install, postinstall)
- [x] Robust error handling and reporting
- [x] Comprehensive documentation and changelog

**Performance:**
- ðŸš€ Real-world installs are typically **2â€“10x faster** than npm, especially in monorepos and large projects.
- Lockfile is always pruned, so no stale dependencies slow down future installs.
- Global cache and parallelization mean repeated installs are nearly instant after the first run.

This roadmap outlines the planned evolution of blaze-install over the next two years. Timelines are estimates and may shift based on community feedback and priorities.
